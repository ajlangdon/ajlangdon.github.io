<!-- _using computational neuroscience to understand the algorithms that support reward prediction and learning in the brain_ -->

I am an Associate Research Scholar working with Yael Niv at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton University, where I co-direct research in the lab focused on the neural computations that support reward prediction and learning in the brain.

<!-- understanding biologically plausible mechanisms for reward prediction and learning in the brain and in behavior. -->

I bring tools from my background in physics, my PhD training in computational neuroscience and my postdoctoral research in reinforcement learning to develop biologically plausible algorithms that give novel insight into how animals and humans learn to predict events and outcomes directly from observing and interacting with their environment.
